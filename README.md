# Here are the data and code for the article "Data-Driven Evaluation on Thermal Effects and Temperature Changes of Lithium-Ion Battery"

LSTM.py was used for predicting the temperature change of battery.
LSTM-data-M-all.csv was the example for LSTM.py

Decomposition.py was used for analyzing the heat generation of battery and distingushing the types of heat.
Batter-M-Segment101.csv was the example for Decomposition.py
